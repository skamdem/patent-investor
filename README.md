*“Investing for everyone, from the Cash-strapped to the deep-pocketed.”*

In the face of constant innovation, help intellectual-property-aware investors make the right decision about which company to invest in, which patents to buy, lease or sell according to current market trends OR which stock to track given the corresponding company’s patent portfolio in promising and emerging technologies.

Promising future-proof fields for sustainable investments include but are not limited to: biotech, nanotech, cognitive science, robotics, AI, IoT, 5G, Serverless computing, Blockchain, 3D printing, cloud computing, fintech etc.

This application would help locate companies (i.e. stocks) with a **rich patents portfolio** in these fields as a strong signal for future sustained profitability. The rationale behind ***patented stocks*** is that investors often seek a form of *protection and guarantee* regarding the long-term profitability of their assets. Patents provide a *legal hedge* against cutthroat competition for *hot products & services* released or offered by these companies. As long as the [USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/) -issued patent is legally valid and enforced, there are assurances that the technology/product is protected and consequently, the companies will keep making generous returns in a *legally protected* manner with little competition for their innovative products & services.

### Resources:
- The [**United States Patent and Trademark Office**](https://www.uspto.gov/) (hereafter **USPTO**) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce that issues patents to inventors and businesses for their inventions, and trademark registration for product and intellectual property identification.
Data used in the visualization is pulled from the [USPTO API](https://developer.uspto.gov/api-catalog) in real-time. USPTO periodically refreshes the data behind their API.
- [**IEX Cloud**](https://iexcloud.io/) is a platform that makes financial data and services accessible to everyone through their [IEX API](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/).
